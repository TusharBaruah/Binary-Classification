The file 'data_hep.csv' contains data generated with the features of the BELLE 2 Detector. There are different reaction types out of which, our code classifies type '0' and '1' as signal and the rest as background.

* We used PCA to reduce the number of features in the data.
* We performed logistic regression to classify the data.
* We have compared it with other classification algorithms.
